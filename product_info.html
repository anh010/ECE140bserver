        Makeshift phone that teaches children to become responsible of important belongings and one's others wellbeing.

          </div>

        <div class=' title q'> Who is Peppets for ?  </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
            PepPets is for middle school children who do not have smart phones yet or dont have a pet but want to own one. Or are unable to own one because of where they live.

          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
            Parents who might be hesitant to shell out the money for a new phone with data plan can be costly might want to consider this as an option.
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
            The same is true for a live animal, So we decided to solve these 2 issue with one small handheld device. 
          </div>

          <div class=' title q'> Pivoting</div>
          <div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              The pivot strategy that applies to our pivot is pivot strategy #4. The customer need pivot.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              This is our pivot because as explained in our irukumi number 7, we are pivoting toward our customer needs.
              We are adding a new custom parent made task feature to our website. The parent will be able to a write a short 
              message/task and select the reward for completing the task. This task will show up on the device, and the parent
              will be the one to confirm completion.  
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              We are making his pivot because we have gotten feedback that they dont want it just to be another thing to buy.
              We hope to include some Interactivity between the parent device and children while at the same time addressing some
              pain points of the parents.

            <aside> A principle that is important in the product, is the principle of choice, from the UI above the options
               are limited, allowing them to quickly interact with the pet</aside>
            <aside> A topical structure is good because we are organizing our main screen UI into 3 main sections,
              menu, which will contain settings, stats, and friends list, Feed which will bring ip items to feed the pet, and levels contain possible rewards
              for leveling up the pet.
